Comma-Separated Values are plain text files that contain a list of data
    comma labels in first row
    data values in remaining rows


Inspecting data with pandas

CSV files can be loaded into python using data frames
We use pandas library which supports data frames

Importing the pandas library
    import pandas 
    import pandas as pds

Data frames (df) are an object that we construct from a CSV file
    df = pandas.read_csv(fileName.csv)


head & tail

indexing starts at 0

To look at the first five rows of the data frame
    df.head()

To look at the first n rows of the data frame
    df.head(n)

Tail works the same way, but looks at the last rows of the data frame.
To look at the last two rows
    df.tail(2)

To look at the last n rows of the data frame
    df.tail(n)


columns

To look at the column names from our data frame
    df.columns
    Index(['int', 'strings', 'floats'], dtype='object')

If we want to convert the object into a traditional python list object
    list(df.columns)
    ['ints','strings','floats']
