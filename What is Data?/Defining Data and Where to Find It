Data is any set of charachters that is gathered and translated for some purpose. 
It is not put into contect and doesn't mean anything to a human or a computer.

Ex. a set of data: The letter A, an image of a cat, a phrase, a video of a
puppy playing with a toy. These all don't come with a connections so they don't mean
anything yet.

    Continuous data can be measured on an infinite scale. 
    We can take any value between two numbers, no matter how small.

How do to get data?

There are open sources of data on the internet via public paltoforms.

For example, Kaggle is a website where we can find publicly available data sets,
build models, and practice coding.

When taking data from these platforms, we want to look for metadata.

Metadata is data that provides information about other data, but not the
content of the data, such as the text of a message or the image itself.

    Ex. Kaggle datasets have information about the author, source of the data,
    creation daate, last modification, file size, etc.
