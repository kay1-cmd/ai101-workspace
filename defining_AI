1950s: Engineering and making of Intelligent Machines and Programs
Used AI to solve difficult problems
1980s: Ability to learn without being explicitly programmed
The subfield AI became popular
2010s: Learning based on Deep Neural Network
Created a larger AI boom. Began using deep neural networks to
process large quantities of difficult data

# John McCarthy, Founder of AI Defines AI as
# the science and engineering of making intelligent machines
# especially intelligent computer programs.
# It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand
# human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself
# to methods that are biologically observable #
# i.e. A discipline concerned with the designing of computers that
# make predictions and decisions. AI4ALL
