There are multiple ways to acieve Artificial intelligence.
One way is through Machine Learning.

Traditional Programming

program + data = output

Machine Learning
Output + Multiple Data = Program & More Output/New Data

Machine learning is a subset of AI
It consists of the techniques that enable computers to learn from the
data and deliver AI applications

We consider a computer program capable of learning if it can:
- Complete a task T
- Improve with experience E
- Based on its performance P

Ex. Email Providers employinh a combination of ML techniques to learn and identify spam mail by prev. identified spam messages

Task: Classify emails as spam or not spam
Experience: Analyze emails and compare to human-labeled spam
Performance: percentage of emails correctly classified as spam

The are subsets of Machine Learning: e.g Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning

Supervised learning focuses on predicting outcomes for new unseen data

Goal: predict outcomes for new data

Accomplised by learning a model from previous examples (data) and their outcomes

Apply the learned model to the new data to predict outcomes


Unsupervised Learning seeks to drwa insights from larger data

Goal: draw insights from large volumes of data

Accomplished by discovering hidden patterns in data without the need for human intervention
